  abstract = {Gearboxes are the most widely used elements for transferring speed and power in many industrial machines. High-precision gearbox fault diagnosis is quite significant for keeping the machine systems work normally and safe. Owing to various unseen single or compound faults, it is pretty difficult to realize high-precision intelligent fault diagnosis of gearboxes using existing methods. In addition, existing intelligent fault diagnosis solutions heavily rely on manual feature extraction and selection using complicated signal processing techniques. In this study, a novel compound fault diagnosis method of the gearbox is proposed by integrating convolutional neural network (CNN) with wavelet transform (WT) and multi-label (ML) classification, namely WT-MLCNN. The developed WT-MLCNN approach involves two parts. In the first part, WT is adopted to extract 2-D time-frequency features from raw 1-D vibration signals. In the second part, the extracted features are inputted into the built MLCNN model to realize compound fault diagnosis of the gearbox. Two main contributions are concluded by comparing to the previous works: first, the proposed method directly uses raw vibration signals to carry out fault diagnosis in an end-to-end way, greatly reducing the reliance on human expertise and manual intervention; second, the appropriate network architecture of the MLCNN model is designed to realize compound fault diagnosis of the gearbox effectively and efficiently. Finally, two case studies are implemented to verify the presented method. The results indicate that it can achieve higher accuracy than other existing methods in literatures. Moreover, its performance in stability is pretty good as well},

Many adversarial learning methods train domain classifier networks to distinguish the features as either a source or target and train a feature generator network to mimic the discriminator. Two problems exist with these methods. First, the domain classifier only tries to distinguish the features as a source or target and thus does not consider task-specific decision boundaries between classes. Therefore, a trained generator can generate ambiguous features near class boundaries. Second, these methods aim to completely match the feature distributions between different domains, which is difficult because of each domain's characteristics.},

  abstract = {Unsupervised domain adaptation (DA) provides a promising approach for tackling fault diagnosis tasks of target datasets without labeled data and has been actively studied in recent years. Most of them focus only on single-source DA, compared to multisource DA (MDA), which has remarkable advantages in generalized knowledge learning and generalization performance. Nevertheless, there are very few fault diagnosis studies based on MDA, and it remains challenging to reduce multiple domain shifts to improve diagnostic performance and mitigate negative transfer during learning. To this end, a novel unsupervised MDA-based transfer learning approach called multisource domain factorization network (MDFN) is proposed in this paper, where the generalized diagnosis knowledge is learned from multiple sources and then used for diagnosing the target task. The highlights of MDFN are that the shared-space component analysis and transferability-based entropy penalty strategy are employed to significantly mitigate negative transfer from the two levels of feature representation and instance transferability and effectively learn shared feature representation. Therefore, the MDFN can extract shared features that combine domain-invariance and discriminability, thereby performing better. The results of two experimental cases on six datasets, including cross-operating-condition and cross-component diagnosis tasks, validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.},
